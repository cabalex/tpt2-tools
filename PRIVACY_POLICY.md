# TPT2 Tools Privacy Policy

TPT2 Tools is a static site that does not transmit personally identifiable data except to Roblox (when necessary). However, some data may be stored on device for convenience.

When connecting to Roblox services, data will be sent to their platform. For more information about how they use your data, visit [Roblox's Privacy Policy](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004630823-Roblox-Privacy-and-Cookie-Policy).

The website hoster, GitHub Pages, may also collect information about you. For more information, please visit the [GitHub General Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

## Information Collected

When you log in and connect your account to the site, your account's refresh token is stored on your device to allow uploading decals to Roblox. This token is used to create an access token when you visit the site, which is then used to:

- Upload decals you create
- Check the status of asset uploads
- Get details about who owns the token

No data is uploaded to Roblox without user consent (i.e. clicking the "Upload to Roblox" button).

## Clearing Data

To remove your Roblox account token, simply visit your browser's settings and clear on-device data for the TPT2 Tools website. This will clear all data and disconnect your account from the site.
